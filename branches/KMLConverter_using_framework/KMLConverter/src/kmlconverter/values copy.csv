"The BAC 1-11 was instructed to line up on R/W24R at Manchester, behind a landing A320.  Shortly afterwards, a B747 reported on final approach for R/W24R, and advised that the a/c was very heavy and would require the full length of the R/W.  After landing, the A320 was slow to vacate the R/W, and by the time it had vacated and the BAC1-11 was cleared for take off, the B747 was approx 1.5 nm from touchdown.  The BAC1-11 began its take off when the B747 was at 0.5 nm.  The B747 pilot reported visual with the traffic and was cleared to land after the departing traffic.  However, the B747 pilot elected to carry out a go-around and to make a right turn.  Subsequently the controller instructed the B747 to turn onto 330 deg and climb to 3500 ft., whilst the BAC1-11 continued on its outbound routing involving a left turn after departure.  The closest point between the B747 and the BAC1-11 was when the BAC1-11 was still rolling down the R/W and the B747 had commenced its right turn, a distance of approx 480 m.  The incident was subject to assessment by UKAB, and to a Field Investigation by the AAIB.  See AAIB Bulletin No 6/2001, Ref EW/C2000/9/5. CAA Closure: Appropriate ATC personnel action taken."

"CAA Closure.  The PA28 pilot who was joining the circuit from the North,  had been advised by the AFISO  to report on right base leg for r/w 27R, no traffic in the right hand, fixed wing, circuit  but that the left hand helicopter circuit was active. The PA28 pilot , probably caught out by a strong NW wind above 1000ft (360/25kts) which was remarkably different than the reported surface wind (325/05kts), saw the airfield late and overshot the fixed wing circuit on the base leg and flew into the path of the R22 on a left base leg in the helicopter circuit.  Radar recordings confirmed that the PA28 entered the circuit at a ground speed of 125kts. This Airprox has since been independently assessed by the UK Airprox Board (UKAB)."

"CAA Closure: This Airprox involved 2 x SA355 helicopters, operating South of the Thames and an R22, which had been told to remain to the North. The R22 was passed traffic info and reported visual with an SA355. Shortly afterwards one of the SA355s reported the Airprox. It appears that the R22 was not sighted on the relevant SA355 and thus came close to it. All a/c were operating iaw with the appropriate rules and the Airprox was therefore due to a non-sighting of a conflicting a/c. This Airprox is now subject to review by the UKAB."

"The Bell 206 was joining London Battersea Heliport from the West, called ATC passing Barnes, and was cleared to join downwind left hand for R/W21.  Traffic information was passed on an SA365 inbound via Vauxhall Bridge.  The specification of a circuit direction to the Bell 206 was at variance with the Battersea MATS Part 2.  The SA365 made its initial call over Vauxhall Bridge at 1500 ft, and was advised as number 2 behind the Bell 206, which was at the time overhead the heliport on its downwind leg.  No specific joining instruction was passed to the SA365, nor was any mention made of the flight remaining North of the river to maintain separation from the Bell 206. It was the controller's responsibility to provide separation in accordance with local procedures.  Due to the bends in the river, the controller could not see the SA365, but estimated that the Bell 206 would complete its approach safely ahead of the SA365.  The controller's view to the East was restricted by trees, and the situation was not helped by the late initial call from the SA365.  When the controller eventually saw the SA365, it was realised that the 2 helicopters were on conflicting flight paths.  Instructions were passed to the SA365, which the pilot found somewhat confusing.  However, the SA365 pilot then saw the Bell 206, and keeping it in sight descended behind it to position as number 2.  The incident will be subject to assessment by UKAB. CAA Closure: No further CAA action appropriate."

Avoiding action given.	"The HS125 was making an ILS approach to Biggin Hill R/W21, to be followed by a go around.  The C525 was to depart from R/W23 on track for DVR to join airways.  A clearance was issued to the HS125 to make a right turn onto a heading of 350 deg, following the go around, and climb to 2100 ft.  Thames Radar passed a departure clearance for the C525 with the condition ""Release subject your traffic"".  When the HS125 reported in the right turn the Biggin controller cleared the C525 for take off.  The weather was poor and visual separation was not possible.  When the Biggin controller checked with Thames Radar to ensure the situation was safe he found that the HS125 was only 1 nm West of the aerodrome.  It was too late to prevent the C525 taking off and so it was stopped at 1200 ft.  Both controllers believed the other was providing separation between the 2 a/c.  The incident will be subject to assessment by UKAB. CAA Closure: Appropriate local ATC action taken."

The glider was seen by the C501 pilot, who carried out a descending turn to the left to avoid.  The incident will be subject to assessment by UKAB. CAA Closure: No further CAA action required."

The Hughes passed the R22 from right to left 50 m ahead.  The Hughes 500 was joining Redhill but using outdated planning information, was unfamiliar with the aerodrome and had not obtained PPR.  Incorrect joining procedures were flown, and the Hughes pilot failed to follow ATC instructions thus not integrating safely into the visual circuit.  The Hughes pilot saw the R22 as it passed just to the left, almost below at an estimated 150-200 ft.  The incident was subject to assessment by UKAB. CAA Closure: No further CAA action required."

"The LTCC MATS Part 2 procedures require Thames Radar/Heathrow SVFR controllers to coordinate overflying helicopters with London Heliport ATC. On this occasion, neither the mentor/trainee radar controllers or the coordinator ensured that this occurred when the AS355 was routed along H4/H3. The Heliport ADC noticed the (unknown) AS355 after the AS365 had departed behind it. The pilot of the AS365 then reported sighting the AS355 ahead. Appropriate ATC personnel action taken. CAA Closure: The hazard is adequately controlled by the actions stated above. This AIRPROX will be subject to a separate review by the United Kingdom AIRPROX Board (UKAB)."
